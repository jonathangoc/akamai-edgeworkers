# Akamai EdgeWorkers
EdgeWorkers enables developers to create and deploy micro-services across more than a quarter of a million edge servers deployed around the globe.

# How can you use this service?
The EdgeWorkers service makes it possible for you to deploy JavaScript functions at the edge and create customized experiences for your website visitors. Like most serverless solutions, EdgeWorkers scripts are invoked at the four different phases of an HTTP request. This provides an opportunity to improve performance, by moving compute closer to your users. Using every edge server as a compute node also accelerates your development and deployment times by applying solutions on a massive scale across the entire, globally distributed, Akamai Intelligent Edge Platform.

Once you add EdgeWorkers to your configuration, developers can activate code outside of Control Center. Just activate custom scripts and efficiently implement site enhancements. You can write functions that access HTTP headers, cookies, and URLs in order to construct complex logic. With access to both content targeting data and device characteristics, you can build personalized solutions based on the location or the type of device making the request. Here are some examples of how you can use the EdgeWorkers service:

* Redirect requests based on geography, device, and user-agent
* Apply conditional logic to filter traffic and construct responses
* Add or remove debug information from an HTTP message
* Respond with custom error responses, even when the origin is down
